### Agonism and Antagonism: Introduction

### Author(@slack): Kanu Calista (@Calista00)

### Agonism is a pharmacological term that refers to the activation of a receptor by a drug or molecule, leading to a biological response (Kenakin, 2018, p. 12). 

### Antagonism refers to the inhibition or blockade of a receptor by a drug or molecule, reducing or eliminating the biological response (Rang et al., 2019, p. 23).

### In drug discovery, the understanding and a basic knowledge of both agonism and antagonism is vital as it helps to dictate the mechanisms and how drugs interact with biological receptors to either activate or inhibit a physiological response.

# Agonism

### Agonism which refers to the activation of a receptor by a drug or molecule, leading to a biological response. Agonism has different types and mechanisms of actions. The types include: full agonism, partial agonism and an inverse agonism. In the full type agonism, a full agonist binds to the receptor, producing a maximal response (Christopoulos & Kenakin, 2018, p. 56). In the partial agonism, a partial agonist binds to the receptor producing a submaximal response (Kenakin, 2018, p. 78). An inverse agonist binds to the receptor, reducing the basal activity of the receptor (Rang et al., 2019, p. 123)

### The mechanism of agonism involves the step-by-step explanation of how an agonist binds to the receptor (Neubig et al., 2018, p. 145), activates the receptor (Pierce & Regan, 2018, p. 167), triggers a response and produces a biological response (Brunton et al., 2018, p. 210).

### Examples of agonists includes; opioid agonists such as morphine, oxycodone (Rang et al., 2019, p. 256). Adrenergic agonists such as catecholamines (Kenakin, 2018, p. 278) and dopamine agonists such as dopamine and apomorphine (Christopoulos & Kenakin, 2018, p. 301).

### Agonism plays a crucial role in drug discovery as it helps in the following ways: therapeutic efficacy, disease understanding, combination therapies and biomarker identification.

# ANTAGONISM

### Antagonism refers to the inhibition or blockade of a receptor by a drug or molecule, reducing or eliminating the biological response (Kenakin, 2018, p. 123). Antagonism has its types and mechanism of actions. The types of antagonism includes: competitive antagonism, non-competitive antagonism and irreversible antagonism. In competitive antagonism, a competitive antagonist competes with the agonist for binding to the receptor, reducing the response (Rang et al., 2019, p. 145). Non-competitive antagonist binds to a different site on the receptor, reducing its activity (Christopoulus & Kenakin, 2018, p. 167). While an irreversible antagonist permanently binds to the receptor, eliminating its activity (Neubig et al., 2018, p. 189)

### Examples of antagonists includes; opioid antagonist(naloxone) (Rang et al., 2019, p.256), beta adrenergic antagonist(propranolol) (Kenakin, 2018, p. 278) and histamine antagonist(loratidine) (Christopoulos & Kenakin, 2018, p. 301). 

# CONCLUSION

### Agonism and antagonism are important concepts in drug discovery, which allows researchers to navigate the complex world of drug receptor interactions. Agonist activates receptors to produce a desired effect, while antagonist blocks the receptors to prevent harmful overactivation. By understanding the principles, scientists are able to develop drugs with improved efficacy, safety and specificity.
